# ML-Portfolio-Optimization

Project Overview

This project implements a sophisticated framework for **quantitative portfolio optimization**, comparing traditional **Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO)** against two advanced methodologies: the **Black-Litterman Model** and an **MVO enhanced with Machine Learning (ML) forecasts**.

It integrates financial theory with cutting-edge data science techniques to generate optimized portfolio weights and rigorously backtests their performance against a benchmark and an unoptimized portfolio. The core objective is to demonstrate how structured investor views (Black-Litterman) and predictive models (ML-MVO) can lead to superior risk-adjusted returns compared to purely historical or equal-weighted approaches.

## Features

- **Data Acquisition:** Uses the `yfinance` library to fetch historical price data for a basket of **Nifty 50 stocks** and the **^NSEI** market index.
- **Multiple Optimization Strategies:**
    - **Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO):** Classic portfolio optimization using historical returns and covariance.
    - **Black-Litterman Model:** Adjusts market equilibrium returns based on structured investor views.
    - **Machine Learning-Enhanced MVO (ML-MVO):** Uses a pre-trained **Random Forest** or **XGBoost** model to forecast the next day's annual return for each asset, which is then used as the expected return input for MVO.
- **Robust Performance Metrics:** Calculates key risk-adjusted metrics like the **Sharpe Ratio**, **Sortino Ratio**, and **Information Ratio** during the backtesting phase.
- **Comparative Backtesting:** Simulates and plots the cumulative returns of all optimized portfolios, the unoptimized portfolio, and the market index over a defined backtesting period.
